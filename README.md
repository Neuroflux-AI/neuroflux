# Neuroflux

### Overview
Neuroflux is a multimodal Grad-CAM-enhanced U-Net-based deep learning model for Glioblastoma Multiforme segmentation

### Running the Project in Google Colab
1. Navigate to neuroflux.ipynb and select **Open in Colab**
2. Select **File > Save a Copy in Drive**
3. Run the notebook with **Runtime > Run all**

### Additional Notes
1. **GPU Support:** Google Colab provides free GPU access, so using Colab will accelerate training. Ensure the Colab runtime is set to GPU by selecting Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU.
2. **Model Output:** The notebook will generate segmented images and Grad-CAM heatmaps showing the areas of the brain where the model is focusing.
